# Celsius4 for Android

## Outline

This is an alpha version of Celsius4 for Android. 

The Android version can only read libraries and its primary purpose is to make scientific libraries created with the desktop version available on phones and tablets.

To create and edit libraries, use Celsius4 availabe [here](https://github.com/cnsaeman/Celsius4).

## Installation

Please download the release file and put your complete Celsius4 Libraries into the app folders, usually called "Android/data/com.atlantis.celsiusfa/files/Libraries".alpha . 

Celsius4 for Android supports files placed on an external SD card.

Currently, Celsius4 for Android does not use the plain text search index, so you don't need/can remove  to add the file "CelsiusSearchIndex.sql" from all library folders, saving some storage space.

Celsius4 for Android will then automatically open all available libraries and display the content.
